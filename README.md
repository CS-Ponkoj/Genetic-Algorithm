Genetic algorithms (GAs) are search algorithms inspired by the principles of natural evolution. 
Here's the basic flow:
Initialization: Create a population of random solutions (often called "individuals").
Fitness Evaluation: Assess how well each solution solves the problem 
Selection: Choose the "fittest" solutions for reproduction.
Crossover: Combine parts of selected solutions to create new "offspring" solutions.
Mutation: Introduce slight random changes to the offspring.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2-5 for multiple generations, with the solutions getting closer to the target solution.
